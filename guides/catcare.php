            <h2>Healthy nutrition</h2>

                <p>  
                    Being carnivorous animals, their diet must include meat, as it is a main source of energy and protein for these beautiful animals.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Make sure their diet is rich in protein and other nutrients, as kittens stomachs are sensitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are not human! Therefore, adding human foods or supplements to a balanced diet can cause very serious problems in their stomach.
                </p>

                <p>
                The three essential nutrients for cats are: <b>Taurine</b> for sharp eyesight and a healthy heart, <b>arachidonic acid</b> for healthy skin and a silky coat and <b>vitamin A</b> again for their eyesight and coat.

                    Although they are independent and picky about their own grooming, they could use a little help. This could also create an excellent bond with your kitten.

                        <h3>Brushing</h3>
                            <p>
                                Could you take 5 to 15 minutes to remove tangled hair. Most cats like to be brushed, but if yours doesn't, don't force it.
                            </p>

                        <h3>A bath</h3>
                            <p>
                                In short-haired cats, a bath is not entirely necessary, but if they are too dirty, a bath would not be a bad idea. But for long-haired cats, an occasional bath can help keep the coat soft and prevent the accumulation of grease.

            <h2>Play with them!</h2>
            <hr size=2px color=#11698E>
                <p>
                    Playing with them is just as important as feeding or grooming them, as they develop their intelligence, encourage their skills and at the same time practice sports.  Cats, being very curious and independent animals, can entertain themselves with many things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A bored cat is a destructive cat, you need to have different options to entertain a cat at home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on the type of game, toy or activity and the interaction the activity requires, your cat will be willing to invest time in it. If he gets bored easiy, it is because he did not find it attractive.
